-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: One of the following types: [computer science, artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, neural networks, natural language processing, computer hardware, software engineering, data structures, algorithms, computer architecture, CPU, memory, hard disk, wireless technology, laptop, notebook]
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: an integer score between 1 to 10, indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Return output in 中文 as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. If you have to translate into 中文, just translate the descriptions, nothing else!

5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}.

及到的敏感问题，需要针对可能产生的冲突及早预防，而不是等到问题矛盾到了不可解决的时候才去想办法化解。在人工智能发展上首先要做好风险管控，这样发展起来的人工智能才是人类之福。随着人工智能的飞速发展，人类必须要加快自身的进化速度从而使人类在人机关系中掌握主动权和控制权。

### 应用领域
机器翻译，智能控制，专家系统，机器人学，语言和图像理解，遗传编程机器人工厂，自动程序设计，航天应用，庞大的信息处理，储存与管理，执行化合生命体无法执行的或复杂或规模庞大的任务等等。
值得一提的是，机器翻译是人工智能的重要分支和最先应用领域。不过就已有的机译成就来看，机译系统的译文质量离终极目标仍相差甚远；而机译质量是机译系统成败的关键。中国数学家、语言学家周海中教授曾在论文《机器翻译五十年》中指出：要提高机译的质量，首先要解决的是语言本身问题而不是程序设计问题；单靠若干程序来做机译系统，肯定是无法提高机译质量的；另外在人类尚未明了大脑是如何进行语言的模糊识别和逻辑判断的情况下，机
