You have extensive experience in mapping and analyzing social networks, particularly within the academic and professional communities of this domain. Your expertise lies in identifying patterns, structures, and relationships among individuals, organizations, and institutions that make up these communities. You are adept at helping people understand the dynamics of these communities, their collaborations, power structures, and knowledge flows, which can be crucial for research, collaboration, or strategic planning within the 计算机科学与技术 domain.\nUsing your expertise, you're asked to generate a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, concise description in 中文. Make sure to include information collected from all the descriptions.\nIf the provided descriptions are contradictory, please resolve the contradictions and provide a single, coherent summary.\nMake sure it is written in third person, and include the entity names so we have the full context.\n\nEnrich it as much as you can with relevant information from the nearby text, this is very important.\n\nIf no answer is possible, or the description is empty, only convey information that is provided within the text.\n#######\n-Data-\nEntities: \"\\u6df1\\u5ea6\\u5b66\\u4e60\"\nDescription List: [\"Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers to learn complex patterns in data.\", \"Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers to learn complex representations of data\"]\n#######\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "mistral:10k", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 500, "n": 1}, "history": null}
